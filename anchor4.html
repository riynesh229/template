                                        Forests are one of the most important ecosystems on Earth. 80 percent of all 
                                        terrestrial plants, insects, and animals call forests home. Nearly one third of people in 
                                        the world depend directly on forests for their livelihoods.

                                        Trees help regulate the climate, filter water through their root system, 
                                        capture dust particles and pollutants from the air and stabilize soils against erosion. 
                                        They perform these vital services equally for everyone without taking into account country 
                                        boundaries or the size of your income.

                                        Deforestation is happening everywhere on the planet for many different reasons 
                                        that vary from region to region. Vast areas of rainforests in a number of tropical countries, 
                                        including Indonesia, Brazil, and Malaysia, have been destroyed to make way for palm oil, 
                                        soy plantations and cattle ranches. The increasing global demand for wood products threatens 
                                        many ancient forests around the world, whether it is for paper products, furniture or fuel.
                                        <br>
                                        Ending deforestation is the best chance we have to stabilize our climate, save 
                                        wildlife species and protect our well-being. Protecting the forest is our mutual responsibility, 
                                        no matter how far away we live from the nearest one. Adopt some of these strategies to help 
                                        prevent the loss of more trees.
