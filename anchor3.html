                                        Forest conservation as the name suggests is the preservation and the protection of forests. 
                                    It also involves the reversal of deforestation and environmental pollution. The preservation of 
                                    all natural resources is absolutely essential for the balance of our ecosystem.

                                        Let us take a look at why forests are so very important to us and our environment. 
                                        We are basically dependent on forests for our survival. And so their conservation is 
                                        of essential importance.
                                        <br>
                                        The most important function of forests is that it produces mass amounts of oxygen as a by-product 
                                        of photosynthesis. Oxygen is the main respiratory gas for all animals, it ensures our survival.
                                        And while photosynthesis, trees also absorb carbon dioxide from the air. This is one of the main 
                                        pollutants of air pollution. Hence forests also reduce air pollution.
                                        Forests also prevent soil erosion and keep soil pollution in check. Deforestation, in fact, leads 
                                        to soil erosion on a large scale since the topsoil comes loose.
                                        Forests also play an important part in the water cycle and control moisture levels of our ecosystem.
                                        <br>
                                        And finally, forests are the natural home and habitat for millions of species of animals, birds, and insects.

                                        While deforestation cannot be avoided completely, we must look to control it. Young and immature 
                                        trees should not be felled as far as possible. We must look to avoid large-scale commercial deforestation as well. 
                                        Adapting practices such as clear-cutting or selective cutting will be beneficial in the long run.

                                        Forest fires are the most common and deadly cause of loss of forests. They can 
                                        start due to natural causes or can be accidents caused by man or even intentional in 
                                        some cases. Once a fire spreads in a forest it is very difficult to control. Precautions 
                                        must be taken for such incidents. Making fire lanes, spreading chemicals to control fire, 
                                        clearing out dry leaves and trees etc.
