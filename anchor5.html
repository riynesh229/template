                                        From childhood, we have heard that trees are our best friend but in 
                                        practical life, we didn't see anyone who treats trees as their friends. Although 
                                        they are the most valuable life source on the earth. They benefit every life 
                                        form in a direct or indirect way. And the earth is connected to them to maintain 
                                        a natural balance. In this essay on save trees, we are discussing the reason why 
                                        our friends need saving.

                                        They nourish us and protect us in many ways. Also, they keep our 
                                        environment green and clean. So, it becomes our responsibility to repay them 
                                        for the things they do for us by saving them. Besides, large trees are more 
                                        beneficial than small ones because they capture more carbon, capture more water, 
                                        combat the heat, filter greenhouse gases, gives shelter from heat and sunlight, etc. 
                                        So, it can be said that we depend on them more rather than they on us.

                                        As we have discussed the benefits of trees in short but here we are going to discuss them 
                                        in detail. Plants and Trees fight the climatic changes that are destroying the earth. They also 
                                        filter the air that we breathe and absorb all the harmful chemical gases and odors from the environment. 
                                        Also, they take in the harmful carbon dioxide and gives out oxygen.

                                        more things that we can't count. Besides, they never demand anything from us and also prevent
