                                        Ethiopia has entered into a landmark $40-million agreement with the World Bank's 
                                        BioCarbon Fund Initiative for Sustainable Forest Landscapes (ISFL). This Emission Reductions 
                                        Purchase Agreement (ERPA) will help communities, government, and stakeholders to reduce carbon 
                                        emissions and increase carbon sequestration through forest preservation and other environment-friendly land uses.

                                        The ERPA marks the first of its kind for ISFL, which will reward efforts to reduce 
                                        around 4 million metric tons of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions through 2030 under 
                                        Ethiopia's ambitious Oromia Forested Landscape Program (OFLP), the World Bank said in a press release.

                                        ISFL grant financing has supported the OFLP since its start of implementation in 2017. It has 
                                        enabled on-the-ground investments that have resulted in over 350 community cooperatives being engaged 
                                        in afforestation and reforestation activities and participatory forest management, with plans and assessments 
                                        covering more than 195,000 hectares of natural forests. Over 46 million tree seedlings have been produced and 
                                        more than 9000 hectares of land have already been reforested. The program has also worked with the private 
                                        sector and governmental entities to promote the adoption of new business models that ensure environmental and 
                                        economic sustainability and development of forest-smart policies that support local initiatives to thrive and scale up.

                                        With the activities underway, the ERPA will bring significant additional 
                                        funding to the program in the form of results-based payments for the verified emission 
                                        reductions. A comprehensive benefit sharing plan is prepared to ensure stakeholders are 
                                        fairly recognised and rewarded for their effort in reducing emissions.

                                        “Signing this ERPA is a reason to celebrate,” said Ato Kebede Yimam, director general 
                                        for Ethiopian Forest Development. “It is the culmination of our careful planning, increased partnerships, 
                                        and political commitment to managing our forests and agriculture sustainably as part of national 
                                        efforts to combat climate change, build resilience, and ensure inclusive green growth.”

                                        “We are proud to sign our first ERPA with Ethiopia and reward the hard work of changing how land 
                                        is managed to avoid deforestation,” said Roy Parizat, ISFL fund manager. “It is particularly 
                                        gratifying to see local communities empowered to protect, manage, and decide on how to use the 
                                        benefits accrued from protecting the forest and improving the environmental sustainability of 
                                        other critical land-use sectors, most notably agriculture.”
