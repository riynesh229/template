                                        There are broadly five categories of forests in India. 
                                        They are named as Tropical evergreen forests, Tropical deciduous 
                                        forests, Tropical thorn forests, Montane forests, and Swamp forests. 
                                        Although different geographers divide the forests into many other categories, 
                                        these are supposed to remain uniform throughout the country. Let's take one by one in brief
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        These trees have broadleafs. India also has temperate deciduous forests 
                                        but they are very less in number. These broad leaves are shed in the autumn 
                                        season but it is in case of temperate deciduous mode. The tropical deciduous 
                                        forests have the trees that shed their leaves in the winter season.

                                        These are also called equatorial rainforests. Rainforests are those forests 
                                        which are characterized by heavy rainfall between 1750 mm and 2000 mm. These forests 
                                        incur heavy showers of 100-600 cm a year, so they are named so. Coffee, bananas, and 
                                        chocolates come from tropical rainforests.

                                        This type of forest is found in mountain or hilly areas. These areas include the hilly 
                                        area of Himalayas and Vindhyas or Nilgiri hills. The forests in the northern region are denser 
                                        than in the South. At higher altitudes, fir, juniper, deodar, and chilgoza can be found.

                                        of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh have these forests.
