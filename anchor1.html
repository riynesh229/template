                                        Afforestation refers to the planting of trees in a barren land to create a forest. People often confuse 
                                        this term with reforestation. However, they are two very different things. Reforestation refers to the specific 
                                        planting of trees in a forest whose trees are already decreasing. Therefore, reforestation is essentially enhancing the number of trees.                                             And afforestation is basically creating a whole new forest.

                                            Mother Earth has constantly faced difficulties due to human activities. For instance, the 
                                            exploitation of natural resources, overpopulation, pollution, and deforestation damages the earth severely. 
                                            Therefore, measures like Afforestation are practiced to prevent further damage.

                                            The world is constantly evolving and so are the pollution levels. 
                                            The carbon emission in cities is reaching new heights every day. 
                                            As more and more industries are being set up, larger areas of forests are being 
                                            cleared up. The setup of these facilities, thus, gives rise to deforestation.
                                            Afforestation is the need of the hour. We need it to tackle the global issues 
                                            humans are facing. For example, global warming, soil erosion, pollution, the ecological 
                                            imbalance is just some of the severe problems. We need measures like afforestation and 
                                            reforestation to be practiced on a larger scale. Moreover, as we are witnessing the damage to
                                            earth with our own eyes, we need to do it quick.

                                        <p>
                                            Most importantly, afforestation is something which is very economical and easy. 
                                            It can help in bringing back the balance of nature. Even if one community vows to practice 
                                            afforestation, we can successfully create a whole new forest. The first step has already been taken; 
                                            various NGO's and government agencies are already involved. We need to create awareness about its 
                                            importance to make it happen on a bigger scale.
